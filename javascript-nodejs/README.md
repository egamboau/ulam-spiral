# Ulam Spiral in NodeJS
## Environment

The scripts were written using NodeJS version 20.9.0. All the dependencies are stated in the `package.json` file and can be installed by using `npm install` on the root of this sub-project.

## How to run the scrips
Once all the dependencies are satisfied, the script can be executed on console by using `node . N` where N is the number size of the desired square. For example, `node . 2` will create a $2\times2$ matrix. 

## Unit Testing
The code include unit tests for one spiral, to compare generation and some number positions. To run them, you can execute the command `npm run tests` once the dependencies are installed.
